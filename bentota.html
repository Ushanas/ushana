  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  <p>To prevent the extinction of the turtles, the Sri Lankans established the Turtle Hatchery. In the past, people—typically fishermen—would gather turtle eggs and sell them to anyone willing to pay a greater price. These eggs were fed and cared for after the turtle hatchery opened until they were 2 to 4 years old. There are numerous turtle species, including the Green Turtle, Leatherback, and Olive Ridley. Despite being extinct, fishermen continue to catch turtles for their shells and fish, which is a very lucrative market.</p>
