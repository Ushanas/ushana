            destruction, poaching, and pollution.
    
            Despite these challenges, efforts are being made to conserve Sri Lanka's turtle populations. These efforts
            include the protection of turtle nesting sites, the promotion of sustainable fishing practices, and the
            implementation of beach patrols to prevent illegal activities such as poaching and habitat destruction</p></b>

        <p>Sri Lanka is home to several endangered turtle species that are at risk of becoming extinct if appropriate
          conservation measures are not implemented. Among these species is the Olive Ridley Turtle, which is the most
          common turtle species to nest along the Sri Lankan coast. These turtles face threats such as habitat
          destruction, bycatch, and egg poaching, which have significantly impacted their numbers in recent years.</p>
        <p>Another critically endangered turtle species that inhabit the waters around Sri Lanka is the Hawksbill Turtle.
          These turtles are hunted to be harvested for their unique shell, which is often used in decorative items,
          jewelry, and souvenirs. Hawksbill turtles also face threats posed by habitat loss and pollution in their marine
          habitats.
        </p>
        <p>Moreover, Sri Lanka hosts the largest nesting colony of Leatherback Turtles in the Indian Ocean region.
          However, these turtles are also on the list for critically endangered species. Leatherback turtle populations
          are threatened by commercial fishing practices and climate change, which could change ocean currents, impacting
          their nesting success. The fishing practices that use longlines and gillnets also contribute to the bycatch of
          endangered leatherback turtles, with many getting entangled and drowning.</p>

          <p>Turtle conservation efforts in Sri Lanka have been ongoing for many years, with the aim of protecting the
            country's sea turtles and their habitats. Sri Lanka is home to several species of sea turtles, including the
            green turtle, the hawksbill turtle, and the leatherback turtle. These species are threatened by a variety of
            factors, including habitat destruction, poaching, and pollution.</p>
          <p>One of the main conservation efforts in Sri Lanka is the protection of turtle nesting sites. Many of Sri
            Lanka's beaches are used as nesting sites by sea turtles, and conservation efforts are focused on protecting
            these areas from disturbance. This includes the establishment of protected areas and the implementation of beach
            patrols to prevent illegal activities such as poaching and habitat destruction.
          </p>
          <P>nother important aspect of turtle conservation in Sri Lanka is the protection of sea turtle habitats. This
            includes efforts to prevent pollution and to protect coral reefs and other marine habitats that sea turtles rely
            on. It also includes the promotion of sustainable fishing practices to prevent overfishing and the destruction
            of marine ecosystems.

          <section>
            <p>here are several challenges faced by Sri Lankan turtle populations that threaten their survival. Some of the
              main challenges include</p>
          </section>
    
    
          <ul>
            <li>Habitat destruction</li></br></br>
            <li>Poaching</li></br></br>
            <li>Climate change</li></br></br>
            <li>Pollution</li>
    
          </ul>
          </br></br>
          <section>
            <p>Habitat destruction: Sri Lanka's beaches are a vital habitat for sea turtles, but they are also under threat
              from human activities such as coastal development and pollution. The destruction of nesting sites and the
              degradation of marine habitats can have a significant impact on turtle populations.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>Poaching: Sea turtles are often targeted by poachers who capture them for their meat, shells, and eggs. This
              illegal trade can have a devastating impact on turtle populations, particularly if it is not adequately
              addressed.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <P>Climate change: is also a significant threat to Sri Lankan turtle populations. Rising sea temperatures and
              changes in ocean currents can alter the timing of turtle nesting and migration, which can have a significant
              impact on their survival</P>
          </section>
          <section>
            <P>Pollution: is another major threat to Sri Lankan turtle populations. Plastic pollution, in particular, can be
              deadly for turtles, as they can mistake plastic debris for food and ingest it, leading to injury or death</P>
