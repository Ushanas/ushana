  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Six of the seven species of sea turtles are now in risk of extinction. The majority of it results from the exploitation of natural resources by humans. Thankfully, this hatchery has accepted responsibility for their protection. Beginning with watching over the nesting mother turtles, they next transport their eggs to the safe environment of the hatchery and, on the day of birth, release the young turtles into the sea. If there are problems, they tend to them and only release them when they are well enough to enter the huge ocean.

    All five of the country's species can be found making their nests at Kosgoda, one of the relatively few hatcheries. They are the Hawksbill, Leatherback, Green, and Olive Ridley turtles.
