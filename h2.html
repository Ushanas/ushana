            <p>Successful creatures that have seen the extinction of the dinosaurs include marine turtles. They have been on the planet for more than 100 million years and have persisted in large numbers up until recently. They originated from big, land-dwelling creatures that resembled tortoises. A head, short neck, two long fore flippers, two short, rounded hind flippers, and a tail make up their body. Internal organs are shielded by a structure (box) made up of the upper carapace and lower plastron. They are unable to retract their head and limbs within their, in contrast to tortoises and freshwater terrapins. Although marine turtles lack teeth, their razor-sharp, beak-like jaws are capable of crushing, tearing, or biting prey depending on the species and the nutrition they consume.<br><br>

            <p> There are 250 species of turtles on Earth, seven of which are marine turtles. The other 243 species are terrestrial turtles, also known as tortoises, or dwell in freshwater ponds and marshes. The Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas), Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), Loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) are five of the seven species of sea turtles that nest on Sri Lankan beaches. In addition, Sri Lanka is home to one terrestrial tortoise, the Star tortoise (Geochelone elegans), three freshwater turtle species: Parker's Black Turtle (Melanochelys trijuga pakeri), Sri Lanka Black Turtle (Melanochelys trijuga thermalis), and the Soft or Flapshell turtle (Lissemys punctata punctata).</p>

            <p>The Indian flapshell turtle, black pond turtle, Indian roofed turtle, and three-striped roofed turtle are among the terrestrial turtles that can be found in Sri Lanka. There are many different environments where these turtles can be found, such as rice fields, rivers, ponds, and other wetland regions. They have strong legs and feet to help them move around because they have adapted to living on ground. Many of these turtles have robust shells that provide protection from predators, and they are renowned for living a long time—often for many decades.</p>

            <p>Coastal turtles are a group of sea turtles that inhabit coastal waters and beaches around the world.
              There are seven species of sea turtles and all of them can be found along coastal areas, including the Green, Hawksbill, Loggerhead, Olive Ridley, Kemp's Ridley, Flatback, and Leatherback turtles.
              Coastal turtles are vital to the health of marine ecosystems, as they help to maintain the balance of underwater food chains.
              These turtles are also important to coastal communities, as they are a source of tourism and help to support local fishing industries.
              Coastal turtles face many threats, including habitat loss and degradation, pollution, climate change, and illegal hunting and poaching.
              To protect these endangered species, there are many conservation efforts underway, such as nesting beach protection, reducing bycatch in fishing nets, and removing marine debris from the ocean </p>

            <p>The Brackish Water Turtle, also known as the estuarine turtle or the river terrapin, is a species of turtle that can be found in Sri Lanka. They are known for their ability to live in both fresh and salt water, and are typically found in rivers, estuaries, and mangrove swamps. Brackish Water Turtles are listed as endangered due to habitat loss, over-harvesting, and pollution</p>

            <p>Sri Lanka is home to five species of sea turtles, including the Green turtle, Olive Ridley turtle, Leatherback turtle, Hawksbill turtle, and Loggerhead turtle. These turtles are an important part of the marine ecosystem, helping to maintain the balance of the ocean's ecosystem.

              The Green turtle is the most commonly seen species in Sri Lanka, and can be found in the waters around the island throughout the year. The Olive Ridley turtle is also common in Sri Lanka, and is known to come ashore in large numbers to nest on certain beaches during the breeding season. The Leatherback turtle, on the other hand, is a rare sight in Sri Lanka, and is considered one of the largest species of sea turtles in the world.</p>
