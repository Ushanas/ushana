            <h2><li>Direct killing and harvesting of female turtles</li></h2><br><br>
            <img src="images/t17.jpg" width="1290" height="500"><br><br>
            <P>The nesting period of the turtle is impacted by the direct killing and harvesting of female turtles who come to beaches to lay their eggs, the degradation of nesting and foraging areas for human use, and an increase in human activity on beaches.</P>
            <p>to prevent this we can Protect the female turtle from any potential attackers, and keep the beaches clear of anything that can impede or distress the turtles, such as sandcastles, beach chairs, umbrellas, and other such items.
                Make cautious to safeguard the eggs laid and prevent poachers or other predators from destroying or stealing the eggs.</p><br>.
            <h2><li> POLLUTION</li></h2><br><br>
            <img src="images/t18.jpg"width="1290" height="600" ><br><br>
            <P>The hatchling stage and its plunge into the ocean are impacted by pollution, impediments on beaches, and hatchlings used as pets.

                Ingestion of plastic and other garbage, chemical and oil spills, entanglement in fishing gear, and entanglement in fishing nets are all causes of juvenile or younger turtles dying in the water.
                
                Due to boat hits, entanglement in fishing nets, pollution, and other oceanic spills, older and molting turtles perish at sea.</P>
                <p>to pevent this we can taking part in coastal cleanups when plastic and other contaminants are removed can help mature female turtles have safer nesting areas.
                    Remove plastic and other trash from the ocean that could entangle or consume sea turtles, causing them injury.
                    Use less plastic, polythene, and other materials that wind up in the ocean that are harmful to sea turtles, such balloons.</p>
                <h2><li>NATURAL THREATE</li></h2><br><br>
            <img src="images/t19.jpg" width="1290" height="400"><br><br>

            <p>Predators on land and at sea, including whales, sharks, reef fish, and even seabirds in search of food, prey on hatchlings and older turtles in the ocean pose a threat to the survival of these species. Predators on land include birds, dogs, jackals, land and water monitors, and species of ants and crabs.</p>
